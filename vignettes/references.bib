abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics allows researchers to investigate complex communities of heterogeneous cells. These methods can be applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated cells. While a number of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for analyzing cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve. Here, we introduce a novel method, Slingshot, for inferring multiple developmental lineages from single-cell gene expression data. Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool for inferring developmental lineages and ordering cells to reflect continuous, branching processes.},

abstract = {Dynamic time warping is a popular technique for comparing time series, providing both a distance measure that is insensitive to local compression and stretches and the warping which optimally deforms one of the two input series onto the other. A variety of algorithms and constraints have been discussed in the literature. The dtw package provides an unification of them; it allows R users to compute time series alignments mixing freely a variety of continuity constraints, restriction windows, endpoints, local distance definitions, and so on. The package also provides functions for visualizing alignments and constraints using several classic diagram types.},
